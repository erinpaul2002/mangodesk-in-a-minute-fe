# üìù Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Project:** AI-Powered Meeting Notes Summarizer and Sharer
**Company:** Mangodesk
**Author:** \[Your Name]
**Date:** \[Insert Date]

---

## 1. Objective

The goal is to build a **full-stack web application** that allows users to:

1. Upload a transcript (meeting notes, call logs, or text files).
2. Provide a **custom instruction/prompt** to guide the summarization style.
3. Generate a structured, AI-powered **summary**.
4. Edit the AI-generated summary.
5. Share the final version with others via **email**.

The product should be **functional, minimal, and deployable**, with the focus on demonstrating **end-to-end full-stack capabilities** rather than design polish.

---

## 2. Target Users

* **Business professionals** who need quick meeting summaries.
* **Team managers/executives** who prefer bullet-point takeaways.
* **Project managers** who want clear lists of action items.
* **Students/researchers** who want condensed transcripts of lectures/interviews.

---

## 3. User Stories

### Upload & Input

* *As a user, I want to upload a transcript file or paste raw text, so that I can process meeting notes.*
* *As a user, I want to provide a custom prompt (e.g., ‚ÄúSummarize in bullet points for executives‚Äù), so the output is tailored to my needs.*

### Summarization

* *As a user, I want to generate a summary by clicking a button, so that I don‚Äôt have to manually process long text.*
* *As a user, I want the summary to appear in an editable text field, so I can refine the AI‚Äôs output.*

### Sharing

* *As a user, I want to enter recipient emails and send the edited summary, so my team receives the meeting notes quickly.*

### Deployment

* *As a stakeholder, I want the app to be deployed with a working link, so I can test functionality without setting up locally.*

5. **Email Sharing**

   * Input for recipient addresses.
   * Backend sends summary via SMTP (Nodemailer) or API (SendGrid/Resend).

### Non-Functional Requirements
