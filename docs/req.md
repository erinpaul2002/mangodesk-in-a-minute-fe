Project: Build a Full-Stack Application
The application is an AI-powered meeting notes summarizer and sharer.

How it Works
You should be able to upload a text transcript (e.g., meeting notes, call transcript).


You should also be able to input a custom instruction/prompt (e.g., “Summarize in bullet points for executives” or “Highlight only action items”).


After clicking on “Generate Summary”, the AI should generate a structured summary based on the prompt.


The generated summary should be editable.


Once edits are made, the user should be able to share the summary via email by entering recipient addresses.



Rules & Resources
You are provided with Groq documentation, but you are free to use any AI service such as ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.


No restrictions on the tools you use — feel free to choose what works best.


Frontend must be extremely basic — focus on functionality, not design.



Final Deliverables
Document containing details of your approach, process, and tech stack of choice.
