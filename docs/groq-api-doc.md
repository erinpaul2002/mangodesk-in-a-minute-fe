function_call
Deprecated
string / object or null
Optional
Deprecated in favor of tool_choice.

Controls which (if any) function is called by the model. none means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message. auto means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a particular function via {"name": "my_function"} forces the model to call that function.

none is the default when no functions are present. auto is the default if functions are present.

Show possible types
functions
Deprecated
array or null
Optional
Deprecated in favor of tools.

A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.

Show properties
include_domains
Deprecated
array or null
Optional
Deprecated: Use search_settings.include_domains instead. A list of domains to include in the search results when the model uses a web search tool.

include_reasoning
boolean or null
Optional

Optional
Deprecated in favor of max_completion_tokens. The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length.

metadata
object or null
Optional
This parameter is not currently supported.

n
integer or null
Optional
Defaults to 1
Range: 1 - 1
How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that the current moment, only n=1 is supported. Other values will result in a 400 response.

parallel_tool_calls
boolean or null
Optional
Defaults to true
Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use.

presence_penalty
number or null
Optional
Defaults to 0
Range: -2 - 2
This is not yet supported by any of our models. Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.

reasoning_effort
string or null
Optional
Allowed values: none, default, low, medium, high
qwen3 models support the following values Set to 'none' to disable reasoning. Set to 'default' or null to let Qwen reason.

response_format
object / object / object or null
Optional
An object specifying the format that the model must output. Setting to { "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} } enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. json_schema response format is only available on supported models. Setting to { "type": "json_object" } enables the older JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON. Using json_schema is preferred for models that support it.

Show possible types
search_settings
object or null
Optional
Settings for web search functionality when the model uses a web search tool.

Show properties
seed
integer or null
Optional
If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same seed and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the system_fingerprint response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.

service_tier
string or null
Optional
Allowed values: auto, on_demand, flex, performance, null
The service tier to use for the request. Defaults to on_demand.

auto will automatically select the highest tier available within the rate limits of your organization.
flex uses the flex tier, which will succeed or fail quickly.

Show possible types
store
boolean or null
Optional
This parameter is not currently supported.

Optional
Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set stream: true.

Show properties
temperature
number or null
Optional
Defaults to 1
Range: 0 - 2
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.

tool_choice
string / object or null
Optional
Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. none means the model will not call any tool and instead generates a message. auto means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. required means the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}} forces the model to call that tool.

none is the default when no tools are present. auto is the default if tools are present.

Show possible types
tools
array or null
Optional
A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for. A max of 128 functions are supported.

Show properties
top_logprobs
integer or null
Optional
Range: 0 - 20
This is not yet supported by any of our models. An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. logprobs must be set to true if this parameter is used.

top_p
number or null

Range: 0 - 1
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

user
string or null
Optional
A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help us monitor and detect abuse.

Returns
Returns a chat completion object, or a streamed sequence of chat completion chunk objects if the request is streamed.
